# Wireframe Consistency Fixes - Offline-First Alignment

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Wireframe (`dashboard.md`)
**Problem**: Showed server-dependent quick actions inconsistent with HTML mockup

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ Removed: "Compare Rates" quick action 
- ❌ Removed: "Balance Transfer" quick action
- ✅ Added: "View Strategies" (offline strategy hub)
- ✅ Added: "EMI Calculator" (offline calculations)
- ✅ Updated: Content requirements emphasize offline-first approach
- ✅ Updated: User flows to reflect offline features

### 2. Strategies Wireframe (`strategies.md`) 
**Problem**: Referenced server-dependent comparison features

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ "Rate Reality Check" → ✅ "Rate Awareness Guide"
- ❌ "Balance Transfer Calculator" → ✅ "Transfer Analysis Tool" 
- ❌ "RBI Rate Impact Predictor" → ✅ "Rate Change Impact Calculator"
- ✅ Updated category name: "Smart Comparisons" → "Smart Analysis"
- ✅ Emphasized offline capabilities and educational content

### 3. Progress Wireframe (`progress.md`)
**Problem**: Achievement names referenced server-dependent actions

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ "Rate Optimizer" achievement → ✅ "Rate Strategist" 
- ❌ "Balance Transfer" achievement → ✅ "Optimization Expert"
- ❌ "balance transfer" opportunity alert → ✅ "available strategies"

### 4. User Flows (`user-flows.md`)
**Problem**: Flow diagrams showed server-dependent pathways

**Changes Made**:
- ❌ "Compare Rates → Market Data" → ✅ "View Strategies → Strategy Hub"
- ❌ "Balance Transfer → Calculator" → ✅ "EMI Calculator → Advanced Calc"
- ✅ Updated category references throughout

### 5. Documentation (`README.md`)
**Problem**: Category naming inconsistency

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Updated: "Smart Comparisons" → "Smart Analysis" 

## Consistency Verification

### HTML Mockup Quick Actions (Correct) ✅
1. Calculate Savings
2. Rate Awareness (offline education)
3. Rate Analysis (offline tools)
4. Track Progress

### Updated Wireframe Quick Actions (Now Consistent) ✅
1. Calculate Savings
2. View Strategies (leads to offline strategy hub)
3. EMI Calculator (advanced offline calculations)
4. Track Progress

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Offline-First**: All features work without internet connectivity
2. **Educational Focus**: Replace server comparisons with educational content
3. **Local Analysis**: Provide scenario modeling without external data
4. **Consistent Naming**: Align all wireframes with HTML implementation
5. **Flutter-Ready**: Clear offline specifications for development handover

## Impact for Flutter Developer

- ✅ No confusion about server dependencies
- ✅ Clear offline-first requirements
- ✅ Consistent feature naming across all design documents
- ✅ Educational/informational approach instead of real-time comparisons
- ✅ All wireframes now match HTML mockup specifications

The wireframes are now fully aligned with the offline-first HTML mockups and ready for flutter-developer implementation.
