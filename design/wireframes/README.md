## Project Overview

This design focuses on creating an intuitive content presentation system for displaying complex financial strategies in a mobile environment. The primary challenge is presenting detailed financial information that helps users make informed decisions without overwhelming them.

### 2. Mobile-First Content Strategy
- Scannable content chunks (5-7 words per line)
- Thumb-friendly interaction zones
- Vertical scrolling with clear section breaks

### 3. Trust Through Transparency
- Show calculations behind savings claims
- Present risks alongside benefits
- Provide clear implementation difficulty indicators

### 4. Visual Hierarchy for Financial Data
- Hero numbers for immediate impact recognition
- Before/after comparisons for context
- Timeline visualizations for long-term benefits
