### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues Found:**

1. **Data Format Issues:**
   - JSON is well-structured but verbose (has extra fields we don't need)
   - Some fields like "headquarters_location", "established_year" are unnecessary
   - Only 2 banks provided in sample (need at least 15)

2. **Missing Critical Data:**
   - Current RBI repo rate
   - Rate update timestamp for each bank
   - PMAY subsidy calculator formula
   - Stamp duty rates by state

3. **Data Accuracy Concerns:**
   - Interest rates seem realistic (8.4% - 10.5% range)
   - PMAY subsidy amounts are correct
   - Tax benefits limits are accurate for FY 2024-25

### üîÑ **Required Modifications:**

1. Need to trim unnecessary fields
2. Add missing repo rate
3. Ensure 15 banks minimum
4. Add last_updated timestamp per bank
5. Include stamp duty data

## Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH MODIFICATIONS** - The data structure is good but needs:
1. Complete 15 banks data
2. Remove unnecessary fields
3. Add missing critical data points
4. Create a leaner JSON for production use
