## 1. Extra EMI Yearly (13th EMI) Strategy

### Core Concept
Pay 13 EMIs instead of 12 every year by making one additional EMI payment annually.

### Hero Numbers (₹50L @ 8.5% for 20 years)
- **Interest Saved**: ₹8.2 lakhs
- **Time Saved**: 3.2 years early

- **ROI**: 1,890% over loan tenure

### When It Works Best

- Emergency fund remains intact

### Implementation Steps
1. **Plan Early (January)**: Calculate one EMI amount and set up monthly savings
