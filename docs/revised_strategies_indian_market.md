## ❌ Strategies That DON'T Work in India

### 1. **Bi-weekly Payments**
- **Why it doesn't work**: Indian banks don't have bi-weekly EMI systems
- **Alternative**: Use Extra EMI strategy instead (similar impact)

### 2. **Mortgage Recasting**
- **Why it doesn't work**: Not available in Indian banking system
- **Alternative**: Part-prepayment with tenure reduction

### 3. **Offset Accounts**
- **Why it doesn't work**: Only SBI MaxGain and few banks offer this
- **Alternative**: Regular prepayments from savings

## 🚫 Common Indian Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Keeping loan for tax benefit**
   - Tax saved: ₹60,000/year
   - Interest paid: ₹4,00,000/year
   - Net loss: ₹3,40,000/year

2. **Investing instead of prepaying**
   - Unless returns > 12% post-tax
   - Loan prepayment is guaranteed return

3. **Waiting for "better time"**
   - Every month delayed costs ₹30,000+ in interest
   - Start with small amounts

4. **Not checking prepayment charges**
   - Floating rate: Usually 0%
   - Fixed rate: 2-4% penalty
   - Switch to floating first

5. **Ignoring balance transfer**
   - Even 0.25% saves lakhs
   - Check every 2 years
