### 🔄 One-Time vs Continuous Impact

| Application | Extra Paid | Interest Saved | Time Reduced |
|-------------|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Once (Year 5) | ₹43,391 | ₹89,000 | 2 months |
| Every Year | ₹6,50,865 | ₹8,45,000 | 5.2 years |
| Every 6 months | ₹13,01,730 | ₹14,20,000 | 8.1 years |

### ✅ When It Works Best
- ✓ Stable income with yearly bonus
- ✓ Tax refunds available
- ✓ Disciplined savers
- ✓ Early in loan tenure (first 10 years)

### ❌ When It Won't Work
- ✗ Tight monthly budget
- ✗ No bonus/irregular income
- ✗ High-interest debt elsewhere
- ✗ Last 5 years of loan (minimal impact)

### ⚠️ Risk Factors
- **Liquidity Risk**: Low - only ₹3,600/month extra
- **Opportunity Cost**: Consider if investments yield >8.5%
- **Prepayment Penalty**: Check if bank charges (usually 0 for floating)

### 📱 Implementation Steps
```
1. Set Calendar Reminder (December)
2. Transfer Extra EMI to Loan Account
3. Mark as "Principal Payment"
4. Get Updated Amortization Schedule
5. Track Savings in App
```
