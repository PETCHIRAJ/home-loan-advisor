## 🎯 Strategy Presentation Framework

### For EACH Strategy Show (Essential Only):

## 1️⃣ **Festival Bonus Prepayment**

### 💰 The Big Number
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════╗
║   SAVE ₹6,80,000                 ║
║   Using Diwali & Year-end Bonus  ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════╝
```

### 📖 What It Is
**Simple Explanation**: "Use your festival bonuses (Diwali, year-end) for loan prepayment instead of spending or investing elsewhere."

### 💡 Real Impact Calculator
```
Your Loan: ₹50,00,000 @ 8.5% for 20 years

WITH FESTIVAL BONUS STRATEGY:
├─ Annual Bonus Used: ₹2,50,000
├─ 10-year Total Prepaid: ₹25,00,000
├─ Interest Saved: ₹6,80,000
├─ Time Saved: 4.2 years
└─ ROI: 27% on bonus amount
```

### 📊 Visual Before/After
```
WITHOUT Strategy:
Total Payable: ₹1,04,13,840
Loan Duration: 20 years

WITH Strategy:
Total Payable: ₹97,33,840
Loan Duration: 15.8 years
NET BENEFIT: ₹6,80,000 less + 4.2 years faster
```

### ✅ When It Works Best
- You get annual bonuses (Diwali, performance, year-end)
- Bonus amount is ₹1L+ per year
- You're in first 15 years of loan
- No high-interest debt elsewhere

### ❌ When It Won't Work
- No regular bonuses
- Bonus needed for emergency fund
- Better investment opportunities >10% returns
- Last 5 years of loan (minimal impact)

### 💳 Implementation Guide
```
Step 1: Calculate your typical annual bonus
Step 2: Set aside for taxes (if applicable)
Step 3: Transfer remaining to loan account
Step 4: Specify "Principal prepayment"
Step 5: Get updated loan schedule
```

### ⚠️ Things to Consider
- **Tax Impact**: Ensure you have tax money separate
- **Emergency Fund**: Keep 3-6 months expenses untouched
- **Opportunity Cost**: Compare with other high-return investments
- **Liquidity**: Money goes to loan, can't get back easily
