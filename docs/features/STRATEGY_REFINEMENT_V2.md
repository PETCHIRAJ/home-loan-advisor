## Overview

## Executive Summary

- **Removed**: 3 life-event strategies with low effectiveness
- **Modified**: Coffee-to-EMI renamed to Snacks-to-EMI for broader appeal

---

## Strategies Removed

### 1. ‚ùå Marriage Dual-Income Strategy
**Reason for Removal:**
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Joint finances are sensitive topic across different Indian communities
- **Limited Applicability**: Only relevant for newly married couples (< 5% of users)
- **Vague Benefits**: No clear, calculable savings amount
- **Too Many Variables**: Spouse income, financial goals, family dynamics vary wildly
- **Alternative**: Users can use Increment Allocator when spouse starts earning

### 2. ‚ùå Job Change EMI Planner
**Reason for Removal:**
- **Low Frequency**: Job changes happen every 3-4 years on average
- **Unpredictable Variables**: Salary jump percentages vary (20-100%)
- **Regional Complexity**: Relocation costs, new city expenses add complexity
- **Redundant**: Increment Allocator (Strategy #14) already handles salary increases
- **Better Approach**: Focus on regular increments which happen annually

### 3. ‚ùå Children's Milestone Planner
**Reason for Removal:**
- **Scope Creep**: Education planning deserves its own dedicated app
- **Complex Calculations**: Education inflation, multiple children, school choices
- **Regional Variations**: IIT vs private engineering vs medical costs differ vastly
- **Long Timeline**: 15-20 year planning beyond typical user engagement
- **Future Opportunity**: Can be separate "Education Planning" app later

## Strategies Modified

### ‚úÖ Coffee-to-EMI Converter ‚Üí Snacks-to-EMI Converter

- **Non-Elite**: Coffee sounds urban elite, snacks are universal
- **Flexible**: Users can input ‚Çπ20-500 based on their lifestyle

**Implementation:**
