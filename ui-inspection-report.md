## Analysis Summary

The Flutter web app inspection revealed several key findings:

### Positive Findings:
- App loads successfully across all viewport sizes
- No major responsive layout breaks
- No horizontal scrolling issues
- Flutter app renders correctly using CanvasKit

### Issues Found:

1. **App Structure Issues:**
   - The app appears to be in a loading or minimal state
   - Only 1 button and 0 input fields were detected
   - No navigation elements found
   - This suggests the app may not be fully loaded or has routing issues

2. **Accessibility Concerns:**
   - Very minimal semantic elements detected
   - Small accessibility placeholder element on mobile

3. **Functionality Issues:**
   - Vertical scrolling not working (may be due to minimal content)
   - Limited interactive elements detected

### Next Steps:

1. **Verify App State**: The inspection suggests the app may be in a loading state or has navigation issues. Check if:
   - All routes are properly configured for web
   - The app is fully loading (no JavaScript errors)
   - State management is working correctly

2. **Test Navigation**: Manually navigate through the app to ensure all screens are accessible

3. **Check Form Functionality**: Verify that calculator inputs and forms are working properly

4. **Improve Accessibility**: Add proper semantic elements and improve touch target sizes

The inspection was successful in identifying that the app loads and renders correctly across different screen sizes, but suggests there may be functionality or routing issues that need to be addressed.
